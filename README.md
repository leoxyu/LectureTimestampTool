# Lecture Timestamp Tool

## Inspiration
COVID-19 has been especially hard for all of us. Being a student has been difficult with the sudden change to online learning and has burdened students throughout their university careers. One of the biggest challenges of online education is the consumption of online lectures. Our project aims to solve this problem. We have created a tool that will enhance and optimize the way students digest their online education and lecture videos.
